# AI Agent Documentation

This file documents the use of AI agents in the development of this project.

## Development Process

An AI assistant was used to help generate the initial project structure, code, and tests for "The Mood DJ" application. The assistant helped with:

-   Scaffolding the project with a clean separation of concerns (UI, logic, tests).
-   Generating boilerplate code for the Streamlit UI (`src/app.py`).
-   Creating the business logic for emotion analysis and playlist generation (`src/logic.py`), including a "Dev Mode" for faster development.
-   Writing unit tests for the logic (`tests/test_logic.py`).
-   Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).
-   Generating this documentation file.
